# sportsNews-
The word I can use for these is "Wueh!"
Basically(I use this a lot to a point where I abuse it[sigh]), this application aims to provide a platform where members can share and read others' news and information. Made with a target focus on sports (The NFL; SIKE!!), it is heavily sports-themed but due to testing constraints, don't be surprised if you see news that is not sporty. I was just testing.
Features include ability to type a message, verify your user identity specifications in order to post, read titles and identity specs of other authors and logging out.
All in all, the best statement to summarize this endeavour is "It was but a start, with more yet to come." Mucho Gracia

PS: If it is shown that a certain Indian man created this repository, as has been with many others, please ignore and report that account as many times as you possibly can without getting yourself in trouble(ofc). I think I may have been subject to a cyber attack and as I continuously seek to rectify that minor mishap, please help me channel this anger to see that he does not see the light of day on this account or any other again. Much appreciated.
